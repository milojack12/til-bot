## 🔧 Tech Patterns

- **Build Fix for `site` repository completed:** The `build_fixer_agent` successfully resolved the TypeScript build error in `MdxOverrides.tsx` by correctly implementing conditional rendering for image components in `ImgWithCaption` and `DoubleImg`. The changes were committed ('Fix: Resolve Image prop type errors in MdxOverrides') and pushed to the `fix/update-next-mdx-remote-v2` branch. The build now passes.

## ❌ Mistakes & Lessons

- **Sub-agent for Build Fixes (`fix_build_errors_v2`) failed:** Encountered API rate limit, leaving the `TypeError` and `VercelPostgresError` unresolved. Further attempts may require addressing rate limits or retrying after a delay.
- **Car Rental Search Interruption:** Browser instance reported `tab not found`, preventing direct website interaction for rental bookings. Browser connection needs to be re-established.
- **NVIDIA Model Configuration:** Attempted to configure the NVIDIA model by patching OpenClaw config for `baseUrl` and default agent model. Encountered an 'invalid config' error. Gateway restart is disabled.
- **NVIDIA Model Test:** Test with NVIDIA model failed with a 404 error, indicating a potential issue with the API endpoint.

## 📝 Decisions

- **GitHub SSH Key Setup:** Sub-agent configured Git identity, but manual user intervention is needed to provide Milo's public SSH key for GitHub authentication and pushing commits.
- **User Config Update & Restart Request:** User requested a restart after updating config, but gateway restarts are disabled.
